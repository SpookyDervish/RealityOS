# RealityOS
One day I decided I wanted to make an OS. And so I did. While it took me over a month to stop hitting a brick wall of trying to get interrupts working, I finally had it. It was smooth sailing from there. But overall, this was just a side project because I'm not really gonna work on this anymore.

If you decide to compile this spaghetti monster of code, you will have lots of warnings. **Ignore them :)**
